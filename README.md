# t6b
#Summary:
#This Bash script automates the backup process for a Docker container. It accomplishes the following tasks:

Sets up variables for container names, backup directories, storage destinations, backup frequency, and schedule.
Creates a backup directory if it doesn't exist.
Backs up the Docker container by creating a snapshot and compressing it to a .tar.gz file in the local directory.
Provides options to upload the backup to Amazon S3 or Google Drive, based on the chosen storage destination.
Schedules automatic backups using cron jobs, with configurable frequency and destination.
You can customize this script to fit your specific container and backup needs. Make sure to set the appropriate values for variables such as CONTAINER_NAME, BACKUP_DIR, S3_BUCKET, GOOGLE_DRIVE_DIR, FREQUENCY, and SCHEDULE
